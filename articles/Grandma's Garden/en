My grandma has a beautiful garden
 There are many flowers in her garden
 She has roses  lilies  and sunflowers
 Every weekend I help my grandma water the flowers
 She teaches me the names of the flowers
 We also pick vegetables from the garden
 The garden is full of colors and nice smells
 It makes me feel happy and relaxed
 I love spending time with my grandma in her garden
