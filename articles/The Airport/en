I go to the airport with my sister
The airport is very big and busy
We see many airplanes outside
Before getting on the airplane we check our bags
Then,we go through security
We wait in a big hall
There are many shops and restaurants
We buy some snacks
Finally we go to our gate
We are ready to get on the airplane
It is an exciting day
